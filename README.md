# Mouse randomization app
Poorly designed preclinical studies not only contribute to experimental
irreproducibility and wasted resources but also may result in erroneous
conclusions regarding the treatment effects, which can ultimately spur or deter
clinical trials in humans with the consequent risk of harm. Randomization is
seen as one of the crucial steps to enhance scientific rigor, decrease bias, and
increase the reliability and reproduction of studies with experimental animals.
Among internal validity criteria, randomization is a commonly recognized bias-
reducing instrument that needs to be considered when planning a study and is
to be reported when the study results are disclosed in a scientific publication.
In this context, we developed an app to assist researchers in the process
of randomization and organization of the animals in experimental groups. We
believe that this program will facilitate the researcher&#39;s organization and avoids
possible bias, thus increasing the credibility and reproducibility of the results
and also decreasing the misuse of animals.
